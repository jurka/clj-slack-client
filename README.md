# clj-slack-client

`clj-slack-client` is a Clojure client for the Slack Real Time Messaging and Web APIs.

It's woefully incomplete. I've just been implementing the functionality I need to do real-time messaging in [`lunch-bot`](https://github.com/tonyvanriet/lunch-bot).

The intention is to some day fill out the rest of the web API and also keep the 
`team-state` updated as real-time events come in.

Leiningen dependency: `[clj-slack-client "0.1.5-SNAPSHOT"]`
